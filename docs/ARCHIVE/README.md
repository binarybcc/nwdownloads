# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that has been superseded by the AI-optimized JSON knowledge base.

## What's Here

All previous markdown documentation files (33 files) have been archived here. These files contain valuable historical context but are no longer the primary reference for the project.

## Current Documentation (Active)

**Primary knowledge base** (JSON format, optimized for AI consumption):
- `../knowledge-base.json` - Core project information, tech stack, deployment workflows
- `../architecture.json` - System architecture, database schemas, frontend structure, API endpoints
- `../deployment-procedures.json` - Complete deployment workflows and operational procedures
- `../troubleshooting-rules.json` - Decision tree troubleshooting guides

**Recent deployment documentation**:
- `../DEPLOYMENT-2025-12-07.md` - December 7, 2025 deployment guide (multi-platform builds + setTimeout fix)

## Why JSON Instead of Markdown?

As of December 7, 2025, the project documentation was consolidated from 33+ markdown files into 4 structured JSON files for these reasons:

1. **AI-Optimized Format**: Easier for AI to parse and reference
2. **Reduced Redundancy**: Consolidated 40% duplicate content across multiple files
3. **Faster to Create**: ~1 hour vs 4+ hours for equivalent markdown documentation
4. **Queryable Structure**: Enables programmatic access to specific information
5. **User Preference**: "I will never read these. These are for your consumption" (user quote)

## Historical Context

These archived files document the evolution of the project including:
- Phase 1 requirements and implementation plans
- Architecture refactoring decisions
- Feature enhancement proposals
- Security improvements
- Testing procedures
- Deployment strategies that evolved over time

## Archive Date

## If You Need Something From Here

While the JSON knowledge base is now the primary reference, these files may contain:
- Detailed rationale for specific decisions
- Historical context for why things were done certain ways
- Alternative approaches that were considered but not implemented
- Step-by-step thought processes during development

If you need this historical context, the files are preserved here unchanged.
